                         <i>> What is LMUHacks?</i>
                         <p>LMUHacks is a hackathon at Loyola Marymount University (LMU) for LMU students, by LMU students!
                              We are run by LMU's chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), LMU's chapter of
                              the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), and LMU's chapter of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
                              Engineers (IEEE). Additionally, LMUHacks is supported by LMU's Computer Science department and LMU's
                              Career and Professional Development department.</p>
                         <i>> What is a hackathon?</i>
                         <p>A hackathon is an event where a group of people (or "hackers") form small
                              teams and collaborate to build a minimum-viable product within a limited
                              period of time. Usually, teams are encouraged to build a project with
                              technology or resources that they are not familiar with, so that they can
                              learn as much as possible. At the end of the event, teams show off their
                              projects and can compete for prizes in a variety of categories.</p>
                         <i>> Why have a hackathon at LMU?</i>
                         <p>Firstly, hackathons have many benefits! They can provide those with
                         little experience in a subject area with a beginner-friendly, pressure-free
                         introduction to the topic. It also provides hackers with working projects that
                         can be displayed on resumes, shown off to employers, and even continued
                         into a larger-scale operation. And, of course, hackathons are a great way
                         to meet new people, get some swag, and have a good time!</p>
                         <p>The purpose of a hackathon at LMU is not only to get all the benefits
                              listed above, but additionally to promote interdisciplinary collaboration.
                              LMUHacks is open to all majors, and specifically targeted at computer
                              science majors, engineering majors, and animation majors. It also will
                              teach students new skills that they can use in their future academic
                              classes and professional careers.</p>
                         <p>Lastly, lots of other large schools have hackathons. Since LMU is
                              growing and developing each and every year, we think it is a great idea
                              for LMU to have its own hackathon that it can be proud of, and that great
                              and creative ideas can be developed from.</p>

                              <p>The three pillars below are the areas that LMUHacks
                                   focuses on:</p>
                              <h1>Inclusivity</h1>
                              <p>LMUHacks is open to all LMU students, and encourages
                                   students who might not know a lot about technology to
                                   join and learn. We strive to create an event at which
                                   everyone feels included, welcomed, and encouraged to
                                   do their best work.</p>
                              <h1>Empowerment</h1>
                              <p>Through technical workshops and mentorship
                                   throughout the day, LMUHacks hopes to empower students by
                                   providing them with the tools they need to succeed and
                                   giving them the freedom to pursue their ideas.</p>
                              <h1>Engagement</h1>
                              <p>With the "Hack for Good" category, LMUHacks is encouraging students
                                   to create mindful projects that have the potential to influence
                                   the world around them. We hope to provide students with more
                                   information on how a career in tech can benefit communities of
                                   all scales.</p>

                         <br>
                         <i>> What is the money for?</i>
                         <p>The money is for items such as category prizes, t-shirts, meals, snacks, and drinks for
                              all attendees!</p>
                         <i>> What are the benefits of becoming a sponsor?</i>
                         <p>Sponsors are able to meet directly with students and inform them about their organization,
                              support an awesome event that will benefit the entire LMU community, and get their name on some swag!</p>
                         <i>> Can my organization get involved without becoming a tiered sponsor?</i>
                         <p>We are flexible with how organizations can get involved with LMUHacks, and would be happy
                              to talk to you about different options! Please email us at
                              <a href="mailto:lmuacm0@gmail.com">LMUACM0@gmail.com</a>.</p>
                         <i>> What other ways can my organization get involved at the actual hackathon?</i>
                         <p>Mentors to help hackers debug their code are always needed, so if any individuals from
                              your organization would be willing to work directly with students on their projects, please
                              see the form link below.</p>
                         <br>
                         <p>If you or someone from your organization would like to get involved, please see more details

                         <i>> I'm not a computer science major, engineering major, or animation
                              major. Can I still attend LMUHacks?</i>
                         <p>Of course! All you need to attend LMUHacks is an interest in tech and
                         an eagerness to learn.</p>
                         <i>> What should I bring?</i>
                         <p>Bring your laptop and charger (if you have one, if not, that's okay too),
                              a reusable water bottle, comfortable clothes, and some energy!</p>
                         <i>> Is food provided?</i>
                         <p>Lunch and dinner will be provided for all, and at the opening ceremony
                         we will have coffee and limited bagels. So, we recommend eating
                         breakfast before you come.</p>
                         <i>> What are the workshops going to be?</i>
                         <p>The workshops are intended to give hackers with an interest in a
                         subject they don't know much about a head start! Therefore, the two
                         workshops that are currently listed as 'TBD' will be some sort of introduction
                         to a platform. For example, an intro to making web-apps, an intro to making a
                         game, etc.</p>
                         <i>> Am I able to attend if I can only stay for part of the time?</i>
                         <p>Participants who cannot attend the entirety of the event are not allowed
                         to participate, since it is unfair to students who are able to attend the whole
