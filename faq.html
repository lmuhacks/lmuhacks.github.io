        <h3 class="subtitle-text">
            I'm not a computer science major, engineering major, or animation
            major. 
            Can I still attend LMUHacks?
        </h3>
        <h5 class="text-padding">
            Of course! All you need to attend LMUHacks is an interest in tech and
            an eagerness to learn.
        </h5>

        <h3 class="subtitle-text">
            What should I bring?
        </h3>
        <h5 class="text-padding">
            Bring your laptop and charger (if you have one, if not, that's okay too),
            a reusable water bottle, comfortable clothes, and some energy!
        </h5>

        <h3 class="subtitle-text">
            Is food provided?
        </h3>
        <h5 class="text-padding">
            Lunch and dinner will be provided for all, and at the opening ceremony
            we will have coffee and limited snacks. So, we recommend eating
            breakfast before you come.
        </h5>


        <h3 class="subtitle-text">
            Am I able to attend if I can only stay for part of the time?
        </h3>
        <h5 class="text-padding">
            Participants who cannot attend the entirety of the event are not allowed
            to participate, since it is unfair to students who are able to attend the whole
            time. For questions on this policy, or to inquire about an exception, please email us. 
        </h5>

        <h3 class="subtitle-text">
            What swag am I going to get?
        </h3>
        <h5 class="text-padding">
            A t-shirt, and perhaps a prize!
        </h5>

        <h3 class="subtitle-text">
            Is there a code of conduct?
        </h3>
        <h5>
            Yes! Read below:
        </h5>
        <p class="text-padding">
