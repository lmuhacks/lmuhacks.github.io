            LMUHacks is a hackathon at Loyola Marymount University (LMU) for LMU students, by LMU students! We are run by LMU's chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), LMU's chapter of the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), LMU's chapter of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), LMU's chapter of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), LMU's chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), and LMU's chapter of Quality of Life+ (QL+). Additionally, LMUHacks is supported by LMU's Seaver College of Science and Engineering.

            What is a hackathon?
        </h3>
        <h5 class="text-padding">
            A hackathon is an event where a group of people (or "hackers") form small
            teams and collaborate to build a minimum-viable product within a limited
            period of time. Usually, teams are encouraged to build a project with
            technology or resources that they are not familiar with, so that they can
            learn as much as possible. At the end of the event, teams show off their
            projects and can compete for prizes in a variety of categories.
