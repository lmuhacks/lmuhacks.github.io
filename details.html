        <h3 class="subtitle-text">What is LMUHacks?</h3>
        <h5 class="text-padding">
          LMUHacks is a hackathon at Loyola Marymount University (LMU) for LMU
          students, by LMU students! We are run by LMU's chapter of the
          Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), LMU's chapter of the
          Society of Women Engineers (SWE), LMU's chapter of the Institute of
          Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), LMU's chapter of the
          American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), LMU's chapter of the
          National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), and LMU's chapter of
          Quality of Life+ (QL+). Additionally, LMUHacks is supported by LMU's
          Seaver College of Science and Engineering.
        </h5>

        <h3 class="subtitle-text">What is a hackathon?</h3>
        <h5 class="text-padding">
          A hackathon is an event where a group of people (or "hackers") form
          small teams and collaborate to build a minimum-viable product within a
          limited period of time. Usually, teams are encouraged to build a
          project with technology or resources that they are not familiar with,
          so that they can learn as much as possible. At the end of the event,
          teams show off their projects and can compete for prizes in a variety
          of categories.
        </h5>

        <h3 class="subtitle-text">Who can attend?</h3>
        <h5 class="text-padding">
          LMUHacks is open to all majors, but computer science, engineering, and
          animation majors are specifically encouraged to attend! And, of
          course, it is open to all years! No experience needed to attend!
        </h5>

        <h3 class="subtitle-text">When?</h3>
